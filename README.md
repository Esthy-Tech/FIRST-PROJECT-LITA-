# FIRST-PROJECT-LITA-
My first project while learning Data Analysis with Incubator Hub 
## Project Title : Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to extract valuable insights and knowlegde from data to enhance decision-making, optimize processes and drive business growth, through various techniques including visualization, summary statistics and frequency distribution.
## Data Source 
The primary source of Data used here are data generated in the course of training
## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com) 

For Data Cleaning
For Analysis
For Visualization

SQL - Structured Query Language

GitHub for Portfolio Building 
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we performed the following actions;

Data loading and inspection

Handling missing variables

Data Cleaning and formatting
## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involves the exploring of the Data used during the cause of training

what is the total sum of amount generated?

what is of the total average of the amount generated?

what is the number of regions?

## Data Analysis (Basic Excel Function)
The Excel SUM function returns the sum of all inserted values. For the input, you can combine any sort of numerical values, e.g. numbers, cell references, ranges or arrays.

Syntax: SUM (number1, [number2], [number3], …)

The Excel AVERAGE function returns the average of all inserted values. For the input, you can combine any sort of numerical values, e.g. numbers, cell references, ranges or arrays.

Syntax: AVERAGE (number1, [number2], [number3], …)

The Excel IF function is the most essential function in Excel for logical tests. You can define the value that is returned by this function if the result of the logical test is TRUE and the value that is returned if the result is FALSE.

If you want to test more than one condition, you can simply nest multiple IF functions.

Syntax: IF  (logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])

The Excel MIN function returns the smallest numeric value in a range of values. Accordingly, the Excel MAX function returns the biggest numeric value in a range of values. Both function only consider numeric values. Empty cells, logical or text values will be ignored.

Syntax: MIN (number1, [number2], …)    |      MAX (number1, [number2], …)

The Excel TRIM function removes the leading and trailing spaces from a given text. Additionally, it removes unnecessary spaces between words.

Syntax: TRIM (text)

The Excel CONCATENATE function joins two or more text items together.

Syntax: CONCATENATE (text1, [text2], …)

The Excel COUNT function counts the number of cells containing numbers.

Syntax: COUNT (value1, [value2], …)

The Excel COUNTIF function counts the number of cells meeting a specific criteria. It supports all sorts of logical operators and wildcards (*,?) for partial matching.

Syntax: COUNTIF (range, criteria)

The Excel SUMIF function returns the sum of all cells meeting a specific criteria. It supports all sorts of logical operators and wildcards (*,?) for partial matching. If the range for the criteria check and the sum range are not the same, the sum range can be provided as a third optional parameter.

Syntax: SUMIF (range, criteria, [sum_range])
